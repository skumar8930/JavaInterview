Lambda expression:
It is the short way to define the body of functional interface abstract method.

example:
package java8.interfaces;
@FunctionalInterface

public interface CalculateSquare {
    Double square(Double x);
}

Now we can implement tha square method in any class direcltly as below.

 public static void implementsCalculateSquare(){
       // CalculateSquare  c1= (x)->{ return x*x ;};
       // CalculateSquare c2 = (x)->  x*x;
        CalculateSquare c3 = x->  x*x;// here x is the value which we will pass in square method
        System.out.println(c3.square(2.0));

    }

    2. example
    ===

    package java8.interfaces;
    @FunctionalInterface
    public interface CompareTwoNumber {
        Integer compareTwoNumber(Integer a, Integer b);

    }
    Uses
    =======
      public static void implementcompareTwoNumber() {
            CompareTwoNumber compareTwoNumber =( a, b)->{
            if (a > b) {
                return a;
            } else
                return b;
        };//semicolon required because lambda expression is inline expression

            System.out.println(compareTwoNumber.compareTwoNumber(2,5));
        }

Functional interface :
==========================================
Functional interface is a intefce which have only one abstrat method and it may have multiple static and default method.
@FunctionalInterface annotation is optional for for functional interface. if there is more than one abstract method in interface
then it is not functional interface.
Functional interface is the target of labda expression, lambda expression is used to define the abstract method body.
The argument of  different method of stream Api having any functionl interface type, so that we can use
lambda expression for that.
lambda expression return type is functionla interface type.

Some functional interfaces define in java 8
1. Predicate
2.Function
3.Consumer
4.Supplier
5.Comprator



1. Predicate
======================




















There is two type of operation in java-8
1. Intermediate operation
2. Terminal operation

Intermediate operation results is again stream  of list.
example,

filter()
map()
flatmap()
distinct()
sorted()
peek()
limit()
skip()

In Terminal operation we are not getting stream of list , it give us a single result.
